This is a repo created to storage files related to the High Performance Computing assignment (option A).

## Assignment

The students of the High Performance Computing curricular unit of the MSc in Computer Science and IoT degree are evaluated through this assignment.
Each student will receive an individual assignment task, besides this general document. It will consist of an algorithm described in a paper and the student will program the algorithm, using OpenMP presenting the following scenarios:
1. a sequential implementation;
2. a parallel multicore implementation;
3. a parallel GPU accelerated implementation.
   
For each implementation the student will provide the speedup experimental statistics. The assignments will be randomly attributed to the students which may exchange between them the assignments provided they previoulsy inform the lecturer of this curricular unit.

The assignment folder have the follwing sub-folders:

repo - in this folder is a local Git repository dedicated to keep the versions of the source code that will be evaluated;

docs - in this folder are kept the following files:

• report.pdf containing the assignment report;

• poster.pdf an a0 size poster about the assignment;

build - the folder where the applications are built using the CMake compilation control system.
